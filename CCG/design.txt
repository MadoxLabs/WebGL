Between battles you might find yourself at a spacedock like this one.

Spacedocks have many useful services, but not all of them will offer every services.

This is the ship repair yard. 
Use it to fix damage to your systems or hull

Not every repair yard will be set up to repair every type of system.

You can refit your ship here. 
This lets you buy and sell ship system cards, or replace the hull.

The training facility lets you hire new crew, or level up your existing crew.
Lets see who is here.

Ensign Lee is the only person here right now. 

Being level 1, he can only have a hand size of 1 card.
we'll take him anyway. 

Note that each crew member comes with their own card, just like this one. 
Don't forget to add it to your deck.

We can also buy some training for Captain Smith. 

Training has earned him a new card, "The Sigma Manuever'!
Lets train Ensign Lee as well

Ensign Lee has gained a new stat: +1 damage from Weapons!

Training is a good way to get more cards and skills.

The final service is the Market where you can buy and sell cards.

Regardless of there being a spacedock or not, you can always adjust your deck between battles.

Each crew member can have their own deck to play from. 

Lets take some of our cards and make a small deck for Ensign Lee.
-give Lee fire and repairs

We are ready to continue!
