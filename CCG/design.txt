script

what do we want to show
- enemy : only hull and facedowns
- draw
- on screen : external, one time
- reveal some enemy
- card goes back to deck

> take hit - take damage, some evaded

- fire weapon : its powered

> take hit, we better take action!

- evasive action

> take hit : less dmg

- get full spread : need to redistribute power, no evade, so:
- use jamming

> target weapon - he cant fire

- reroute and use full spread

> fire heavy barrel - 5 to target and one other system, engine is hit

- we drew ramming but cant use it, emergency repair engine

> fire, 

- pedal to the metal

> fire

- ramming
